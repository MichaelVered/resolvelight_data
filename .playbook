    "learning_insights": "The system flagged a supplier mismatch due to a slight variation in the supplier name between the invoice (\"Quantum Apps Company\") and the contract (\"Quantum Apps Co.\"). The human expert correctly identified that the difference was acceptable due to industry standard naming conventions (presence of suffixes like 'Ltd', 'Inc', etc.) and approved the invoice. The system should be trained to be more lenient with supplier name matching, considering common suffixes and abbreviations.",
    "corrective_actions": "Priority 1 [HIGH]: Update Supplier Matching Logic - Implement fuzzy matching or a synonym/alias list for supplier names, specifically accounting for common suffixes and abbreviations.\n- File: tool_library/supplier_match_tool.py\n- Change: Modify `validate_supplier` to include a fuzzy matching algorithm (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or check against a list of acceptable name variations.\n\nPriority 2 [MEDIUM]: Enhance Training Data - Add more examples of invoices with supplier name variations (including suffixes) to the training data to improve the system's understanding of acceptable mismatches.\n- File: N/A (Training Data)\n- Change: Collect and label invoices where the supplier name on the invoice differs slightly from the contract/PO, but are still valid matches.",

    "expert_feedback": "The supplier name \"Pixel Perfect Developers Inc.\" in the invoice can be matched to \"Pixel Perfect Devs Inc.\". Devs is a commonly understood as Developers. These type of industry abbreviation (or shortening or clipping) should be accepted when you match supplier, or client names",
    "learning_insights": "The system incorrectly flagged a supplier mismatch due to a common abbreviation in the supplier name (\"Devs Inc.\" vs. \"Developers Inc.\"). The fuzzy matching logic within the supplier_match_tool needs to be enhanced to account for these industry-standard abbreviations or name shortening, especially when the vendor ID is the same. This can reduce false positives and improve straight-through processing rates. Training the model with examples of these variations is essential.",
    "corrective_actions": "Priority 1 [HIGH]: Improve fuzzy matching in supplier validation - Enhance the supplier matching logic to include industry abbreviations, nicknames, and common variations of business names.\n- File: tool_library/supplier_match_tool.py\n- Change: Implement fuzzy matching with configurable abbreviations and synonyms, and consider using a pre-defined abbreviation dictionary. Weigh the fuzzy match score with vendor ID confirmation. Threshold for acceptance needs adjustment.\n\nPriority 2 [MEDIUM]: Update training data for fuzzy matching - Expand the training dataset with examples of company name abbreviations and synonyms.\n- File: N/A (Training data repository)\n- Change: Add variations of company names commonly found in invoices (e.g., \"Inc.\", \"Corp.\", \"Ltd.\", \"Devs\", \"Developers\").",
